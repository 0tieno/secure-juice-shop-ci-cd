# Final Year Project

## Project Title

“ A framework for balancing security and speed in CI/CD pipelines. A Shift-Left DevSecOps Approach.”

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a secure CI/CD pipeline setup for the OWASP Juice Shop application, focusing on DevSecOps principles. The pipeline ensures security at every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## 📌 Features

- **Secure CI/CD Pipeline**: Implements best security practices in the CI/CD process.
- **Security Analysis**: Integrates security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Uses Azure Pipelines for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for setting up and securing the pipeline.

## Project Phases (5-phases)

Refer to the `docs/` directory for detailed phase-wise documentation:

- **[Phase 1: Setup](docs/Phase1-Setup.md)** – Initial setup and configurations.
- **[Phase 2: Security](docs/Phase2-Security.md)** – Security testing and analysis.
- **[Phase 3: Framework](docs/Phase3-Framework.md)** – Design and architecture.
- **[Phase 4: Implementation](docs/Phase4-Implementation.md)** – CI/CD pipeline implementation.
- **[Phase 5: Evaluation](docs/Phase5-Evaluation.md)** – Performance and security assessments.
- **[Phase 6: Conclusion](docs/summary.md)** – Final remarks and future work.
- **[Phase 7: References](docs/Phase7-References.md)** – Citations and resources.
